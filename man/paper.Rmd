## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "My Demo Table")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, fig.cap = "curve"}
plot(-1, xlim = c(0,5), ylim = c(0,5))
curve(5*x^3,add=T) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# references and footnote

 reproducible research is important [@hillier1976space]
 
 more than one author:[see these ones: @hillier1976space;@jammer1969concepts;@gregory1994geographical]
 
 @gregory1994geographical is a very good paper...

# captions and crossrefs

In figure XX \@ref(fig:pressureplot) you can clearly see a big increase...
But in table \@ref(tab:demotable) we can see...

# packrat

install.packages("packrat")


<!-- then:
-->

```{r}
library(binford)
data(LRB)
knitr::kable(head(LRB))
```

packrat::on()

#packrat::off() turns packrat off, afterwards the folder should be deleted


#checkpoint installs packages from snapshots

install.packages("checkpoint")
